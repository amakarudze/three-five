## FAQs
**This is a silly library to devote your time into building. Why build it in the first place?**

This library is not meant to do anything really. I was once asked to write this program as part of a technical interview
 which I didn't do so well in. I just had to attempt it now to see if I could do it and added other extras such as 
 packaging etc. for fun as well as showing recruiters how much Python I know. This package was mainly done for 
 practice's sake.
